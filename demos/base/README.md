This `base/`  subdirectory contains demo programs for the basic [MicroTBX](https://github.com/feaser/microtbx) software component.

## Overview

* `dynamicarray.c` - Demonstrates how to use the memory pool and linked list modules to build a dynamic array.
* `fifobuffer.c` -  Demonstrates how to use the memory pool and linked list modules to build a first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer.
* `randomdata.c` - Demonstrates how to use the random number generator to fill a data buffer with random data.
* `securedata.c` - Demonstrates how to use the checksum and cryptography modules to store and retrieve a block of data in a secure manner.
* `sortlist.c` - Demonstrates how to sort items in a linked list.
